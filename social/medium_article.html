    <h1>Dimensional Accuracy Assertion</h1>

    <p>
      This is our final year engineering project done using Raspberry Pi 3, a
      camera module, line laser, and a stepper motor.
    </p>

    <p>
      The project can calculate the dimensions of a nut and bolt using laser
      triangulation technique. For bolts, it calculates thread pitch, thread
      height, length, and major diameter. For nuts, it calculates thread pitch
      and diameter.

    <h2>Defect Detection Using Machine Vision</h2>

    <h3>Synopsis</h3>

    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>
      Quality checking is essential in the production of any product. In
      manufacturing, quality control ensures that customers receive defect-free
      products that meet their needs. Our aim is to create a low-cost and
      efficient prototype system that detects defects in an object using image
      processing techniques and estimates the size of such defects.
    </p>

    <h4>Motivation</h4>
    <p>
      Defects in manufacturing, such as dimensional inaccuracies, can occur
      during production. Traditional methods to detect these defects are often
      expensive and slow. Our goal is to develop a cost-effective and efficient
      method to detect these defects early in the manufacturing process.
    </p>

    <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
    <p>
      We aim to develop an automated system that detects and labels dimensional
      defects in objects. The system must be accurate, cost-effective, and easy
      to operate, making it suitable for deployment in production lines.
    </p>

    <h4>Objective</h4>
    <p>
      We present a real-time, highly automated tool for defect detection using
      image processing. The system will perform real-time image acquisition,
      processing, and classification, allowing for the detection and
      classification of common dimensional defects in manufactured products.
    </p>

      alt="Basic Block Diagram"
    />

    <h4>Project Outcome</h4>
    <p>
      The system will take pictures of an object in three dimensions, process
      the images, compare them with reference images, detect defects, and
      suggest methods for resolving any flaws.
    </p>

    <h4>Applications</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Detect defects in manufacturing industries for quality control.</li>
      <li>Detect faulty goods in early production stages to reduce wastage.</li>
      <li>Check for defects in 3D printing and CNC machining.</li>
      <li>Measure dimensions of unknown objects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Literature Survey</h2>
    <p>
      Machine vision (MV) is used in automatic inspection, process control, and
      robot guidance. The technology provides computer-understandable
      descriptions of objects from images. Automated visual inspection systems
      must discover and classify defects in product images quickly and robustly.
      Our project builds upon existing methods by focusing on 3D object
      inspection, where traditional 2D methods fall short.
    </p>

    <h2>Mathematical Analysis</h2>

      alt="Simple triangulation setup with Line LASER"
    />
    <p>
      We use a simple 3D triangulation setup with a line LASER and a camera to
      scan objects for defects. The LASER line intersects the view direction of
      the camera at the axis of rotation of the object, allowing us to extract
      depth-related information.
    </p>

      alt="View from the camera"
    />

    <p>
      Using known angles and scaling factors, we can calculate the depth and
      dimensions of the object. Images of the object are processed to detect
      deviations from reference images, identifying defects.
