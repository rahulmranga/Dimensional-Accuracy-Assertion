      <h2>Defect Detection Using Machine Vision</h2>

      <h3>Synopsis</h3>

      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>
        Quality checking is essential in the production of any product. In
        manufacturing, quality control ensures that customers receive
        defect-free products that meet their needs. Our aim is to create a
        low-cost and efficient prototype system that detects defects in an
        object using image processing techniques and estimates the size of such
        defects.
      </p>

      <h4>Motivation</h4>
      <p>
        Defects in manufacturing, such as dimensional inaccuracies, can occur
        during production. Traditional methods to detect these defects are often
        expensive and slow. Our goal is to develop a cost-effective and
        efficient method to detect these defects early in the manufacturing
        process.
      </p>

      <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
      <p>
        We aim to develop an automated system that detects and labels
        dimensional defects in objects. The system must be accurate,
        cost-effective, and easy to operate, making it suitable for deployment
        in production lines.
      </p>

      <h4>Objective</h4>
      <p>
        We present a real-time, highly automated tool for defect detection using
        image processing. The system will perform real-time image acquisition,
        processing, and classification, allowing for the detection and
        classification of common dimensional defects in manufactured products.
      </p>

      <h4>Block Diagram</h4>
      <img src="bd.JPG" alt="Basic Block Diagram" />

      <h4>Project Outcome</h4>
      <p>
        The system will take pictures of an object in three dimensions, process
        the images, compare them with reference images, detect defects, and
        suggest methods for resolving any flaws.
      </p>

      <h4>Applications</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Detect defects in manufacturing industries for quality control.</li>
        <li>
          Detect faulty goods in early production stages to reduce wastage.
        </li>
        <li>Check for defects in 3D printing and CNC machining.</li>
        <li>Measure dimensions of unknown objects.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Literature Survey</h2>
      <p>
        Machine vision (MV) is used in automatic inspection, process control,
        and robot guidance. The technology provides computer-understandable
        descriptions of objects from images. Automated visual inspection systems
        must discover and classify defects in product images quickly and
        robustly. Our project builds upon existing methods by focusing on 3D
        object inspection, where traditional 2D methods fall short.
      </p>

      <h2>Mathematical Analysis</h2>
      <img
        src="lasercamera.JPG"
        alt="Simple triangulation setup with Line LASER"
      />
      <p>
        We use a simple 3D triangulation setup with a line LASER and a camera to
        scan objects for defects. The LASER line intersects the view direction
        of the camera at the axis of rotation of the object, allowing us to
        extract depth-related information.
      </p>

      <img src="yline.JPG" alt="View from the camera" />

      <p>
        Using known angles and scaling factors, we can calculate the depth and
        dimensions of the object. Images of the object are processed to detect
        deviations from reference images, identifying defects.
